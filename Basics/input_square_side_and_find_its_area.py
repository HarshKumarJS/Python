# Program to input side of a square and print its area

# Taking input from the user (side length of the square in cm)
a = float(input("Enter side of a square (in cm): "))

# Calculating area (side × side)
area = a * a

# Printing the result with unit cm²
print("The area of square is:", area, "cm²")
